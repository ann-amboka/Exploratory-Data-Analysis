# EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS
📝 About the Project

This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) on candy sales data, sourced from a fully built SQL-based Data Warehouse (Bronze → Silver → Gold). The goal is to understand patterns, trends, and insights in the dataset before performing further analytics or reporting.

It is a hands-on project that covers:

Data profiling and quality checks

Identifying trends and outliers

Visualizing key metrics

Preparing the data for dashboards and business insights

👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m Ann Amboka Amukasah, a data enthusiast transitioning into analytics and data engineering.
This project reflects my journey in exploring warehouse-level datasets, cleaning, analyzing, and deriving actionable insights using SQL and visualization tools.

🎯 Project Goals

✅ Explore and understand candy sales data at every level (Bronze → Silver → Gold)

✅ Identify patterns in sales, revenue, and product performance

✅ Detect anomalies, missing data, and duplicates

✅ Prepare summarized datasets for visualization or reporting

🗂️ Data Sources

The EDA project uses data from the Data Warehouse project:

Bronze Layer: Raw sales data

Silver Layer: Cleaned and standardized data

Gold Layer: Aggregated, analytics-ready fact and dimension tables

⚙️ Tools & Requirements

SQL Server / Azure SQL – querying and aggregation

Draw.io / diagrams.net – visualizing schema (optional for reference)

GitHub – version control and documentation

🔍 Analysis Approach

Data Profiling – Check for missing values, duplicates, data types, and ranges

Summary Statistics – Sales totals, product counts, gross profit, etc.

Segmentation & Grouping – Analyze by division, region, product categories

Trends & Patterns – Identify top-selling products, peak order dates, and profitability trends

Anomalies & Outliers – Detect unusual orders, pricing issues, or negative profits

📏 Rules & Observations

All data cleaning and transformations are consistent with warehouse standards (Silver layer)

Traceability maintained via RowID, LoadDate, and source file references

Business logic applied to calculated fields (Gross Profit, Revenue, etc.)

Aggregation and summarization are done at the Gold layer for reliable analytics

📈 Insights & Deliverables

Summary tables of total sales per product, division, and region

Ranked products by sales 

Charts and dashboards ready for business review

Documentation of EDA steps and SQL scripts on GitHub
